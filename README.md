* A user clicks roll the dice once its their turn.
* A score of 1 makes the user get a score of 0 and turn is passed over to player 2
* A score of 2-6(2,3,4,5,6) adds the value to the current score of the player
* A user can choose to hold their score by passing the turn to the next player
* If the player choses to continue playing their turn, a score of 1 will nullify their score and pass the turn to the other player
* A winner is selected after getting 100 points or a value that is greater than that.
